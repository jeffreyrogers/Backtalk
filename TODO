# TODO

## Core Functionality

- Add rest API for creating and viewing comments
- Add admin page with authentication where I can moderate comments
- Cron job or something similar to clear out old sessions

## Improvements

- Store environment variables as globals
- Remove log.Fatals and os.Exit calls
- Use a join in the logged in function to get user permissions directly?
- Tool to generate secrets/passwords
- Create some way of allowing users to authenticate themselves and edit/delete their own comments
- Add comment threading
